Implementation of WaveGAN using PyTorch to generate artificially-made drum sounds

# Implementation of WaveGAN in PyTorch

This is my own implementation of WaveGAN using PyTorch, introduced in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.04208.pdf).
The main task was to synthesize a raw audio of drum sounds and human voice articulating numbers 0 to 9.
